# Pebble 11 Weeks Watchface - Configuration Page

A self-hosted configuration page for the "11 Weeks" Pebble watchface with live preview functionality.

## üéØ About This Project

This is a repackaged version of the excellent **11 Weeks Watchface** originally created by **[programus@gmail.com](https://github.com/programus/pebble-watchface-11weeks)**.

The original configuration page is no longer accessible at `http://programus.coding.me/pebble-watchface-11weeks/html/config.html`, making it impossible to customize the watchface settings. This repository provides a working alternative hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Full credit goes to the original author** for creating this beautiful watchface. This project only re-hosts the configuration interface.

## üì¶ What's Included

- `config.html` - Configuration page with embedded JavaScript
- `js/` - Watch preview rendering libraries
- `resources/images/` - Watchface graphics for live preview
- `.pbw` file - Repackaged watchface pointing to the new config URL

## üöÄ Live Configuration Page

The configuration page is hosted at:
```
https://tensorchris.github.io/pebble-11weeks-config/config.html
```

## üíæ Installation

1. Download the latest `.pbw` file from the releases
2. Install it on your Pebble watch via the Pebble app
3. Open the watchface settings in the Pebble app
4. Configure your preferred options with live preview!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

The page offers the following customizable settings:

- **Seconds**: Display seconds (increases battery usage)
- **Outline Frame**: Animated frame border (increases battery usage)
- **Pebble Battery**: Show watch battery level
- **Phone Battery & Bluetooth**: Show phone battery and Bluetooth status

**Note:** Disabling the outline frame and seconds reduces battery consumption as the watchface will update once per minute instead of once per second.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Live Preview**: See your changes in real-time with a canvas-based watchface preview
- ‚úÖ **Persistent Settings**: Your configuration is saved and loads correctly each time
- ‚úÖ **Multi-language Support**: Auto-detects your browser language
  - English (en)
  - Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans)
  - Traditional Chinese (zh-Hant)
  - Japanese (ja)
